        <p>Venezuelan cuisine is influenced by its European (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French), 
            West African, and indigenous traditions. 
            Venezuelan cuisine varies greatly from one region to another. 
            Food staples include corn, rice, plantains, yams, beans and several meats.
            Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, eggplants, squashes, spinach and zucchini are also common side dishes in the 
            Venezuelan diet. Ají dulce and papelón are found in most recipes. Worcestershire sauce 
            is also used frequently in stews. Venezuela is also known for having a large variety 
            of white cheese (queso blanco), 
            usually named by geographical region. </p>
